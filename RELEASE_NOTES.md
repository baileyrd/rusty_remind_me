# Release Notes

No PR workflow yet on this repo's first commit — this pushes directly to the
`claude/repo-config-danror` branch to establish the default branch and initial
scaffold. Once there's a real default branch and a second change lands through a
PR, switch to one entry per merged PR (reverse chronological), same convention as
[AISF's RELEASE_NOTES.md](https://github.com/baileyrd/AISF/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## Cooperative cancellation + RunContext catch-up (closes #10)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::cancel::CancelToken` — a thread-safe, one-way
  cooperative cancellation signal, mirroring `src/dbs/core/cancel.py` in
  baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned `@6cc6491`). Backed by
  `Arc<AtomicBool>` rather than the reference's `threading.Event` —
  cloning a token shares the same underlying flag, so one token is safe
  to hand to every `--parallel` worker thread, same guarantee as the
  reference.
- **Changed:** `RunContext` gains `secrets: Secrets` and
  `cancel: Option<CancelToken>`. `secrets` should have landed when #6
  merged but was missed — caught up here rather than left drifting.
  `http` (#22) and a logger equivalent are still the only pieces left
  before `RunContext` fully matches the reference.
- 7 new unit tests (uncancelled start, cancel sets/idempotent, clones
  share state, independent tokens don't, cross-thread visibility,
  `RunContext.cancel` reflects a shared token), 53/53 total passing.

## CORE_API_VERSION gating (closes #9)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::versioning` — `CORE_API_VERSION`,
  `CURRENT_API_VERSION` (alias, matching the reference's two-name split),
  `is_api_compatible`, mirroring `src/dbs/core/versioning.py` in
  baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned `@6cc6491`).
- **Changed:** `connector::CORE_API_VERSION` (a placeholder defined
  directly in #4, before this module existed) is now a re-export from
  `versioning` instead of its own definition — one source of truth, same
  public path (`dbs_core::CORE_API_VERSION` still works).
- 3 new unit tests (same-version compatible, different-version
  incompatible, alias equality), 46/46 total passing.

## Timeutil helpers (closes #8)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::timeutil` — `iso_z`/`parse_iso`, mirroring
  `src/dbs/core/timeutil.py` in baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned
  `@6cc6491`). Smaller than the reference: `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` is
  always UTC and always timezone-aware in the type system, so there's no
  naive-vs-aware branch needed on the formatting side — only on parsing
  untrusted input text, where a naive (no-offset) string is still treated
  as UTC, same as the reference.
- 8 new unit tests (zero/nonzero fractional seconds, `None`/empty/
  whitespace input, `Z` suffix, explicit offset conversion, naive-as-UTC,
  garbage rejection, round-trip), 43/43 total passing.

## Content hashing for change classification (closes #7)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::hashing` — `canonical_json`/`content_hash`,
  mirroring `src/dbs/core/hashing.py` in baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System
  (pinned `@6cc6491`). `serde_json::Value`'s default `Map` is a
  `BTreeMap` (this workspace doesn't enable `preserve_order`), so
  `canonical_json` gets sorted-key determinism for free from
  `serde_json::to_string` — no manual sorting needed, unlike the
  reference's explicit `sort_keys=True`.
- **New dependency:** `sha2` (SHA-256). First use of the new "small,
  narrowly-scoped standard crates are auto-approved" policy decided
  mid-implementation — see `gap-analysis.md`'s Decisions section, item 5.
- 6 new unit tests (key sorting at every nesting level, compact
  separators, non-ASCII kept unescaped, order-independence, real-change
  detection, digest shape), 35/35 total passing.

## Least-privilege secrets accessor (closes #6)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::secrets::Secrets` — a read-only, allow-listed view
  over a secret store, mirroring `src/dbs/core/secrets.py` in
  baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned `@6cc6491`): `get`/`get_optional`
  reject an undeclared key with `ConnectorError::Contract`, a declared but
  missing/empty key with `ConnectorError::Auth`; `require_all` pre-flights
  every declared key at once. 8 new unit tests, 29/29 total passing.

## ADR-0001: dynamic plugin registry via subprocess + JSON IPC (closes #5)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `docs/adr/0001-dynamic-plugin-registry.md`, replacing the ADR
  seed template with the first real decision. Proposes subprocess + line-
  delimited JSON IPC for connector loading (each connector a separate
  `dbs-connector-<type>` executable, a handshake self-describing its
  contract, a manifest-based registry) instead of a `cdylib` + stable-ABI
  approach — Rust's lack of a stable ABI makes the `cdylib` path a much
  higher-risk lockstep-versioning/UB problem than a subprocess boundary,
  which only needs a stable *wire* protocol.
- **Known limitation:** this is a proposal (`Status: Proposed`), not yet
  accepted or implemented. The registry implementation itself is a
  follow-up issue once this ADR is reviewed.

## Connector plugin contract + partial RunContext (closes #4)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::connector` — the `Connector` trait and a first-pass
  `RunContext`, mirroring `src/dbs/core/connector.py` in
  baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned `@6cc6491`). `fetch` returns
  `Box<dyn Iterator<Item = Result<FetchEvent, ConnectorError>>>` rather than
  an associated type, keeping `Connector` object-safe (`Box<dyn
  Connector>`) — a deliberate head start on issue #5's dynamic-plugin-
  loading design, which needs trait objects across a `cdylib` boundary.
- **Known limitation, scoped deliberately:** `RunContext` omits
  `secrets`/`http`/`cancel`/`logger` — those depend on #6, #22, #10, none
  of which exist yet. It carries only `source_id`/`source_name`/`cursor`/
  `since`/`run_id`/`mode`/`limit`/media options/`items_failed` for now;
  grows to match the reference once those land.
- 5 new unit tests (default-method values, a `FakeConnector` exercising
  `fetch`, object-safety, `report_failed` accumulation, `ReconcileMarker`
  round-trip through `FetchEvent`) — 21/21 total passing.

## Core error hierarchy (closes #3)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `dbs-core::errors` — `DbsError`, `ConnectorLoadError`,
  `ConnectorError`, `BackupRunError`, mirroring `src/dbs/core/errors.py` in
  baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned `@6cc6491`). The reference uses an
  exception *class* hierarchy (`RateLimitedError` subclasses
  `TransientFetchError` so one `except` catches both); Rust has no
  subclassing, so that relationship is a classification method,
  `ConnectorError::is_retryable()`, instead of nested variant matching —
  same semantics as the reference, idiomatic shape for the language. 5 new
  unit tests, all green.

## Cargo workspace scaffold + core data model (closes #2)
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** the first Rust code in this repo — a Cargo workspace with a
  `dbs-core` crate, mirroring `dbs.core.models`/`dbs.core.capabilities` in
  baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System (pinned `@6cc6491`): `BackupItem`, `MediaRef`,
  `Cursor`, `Checkpoint`, `ReconcileMarker`, `FetchEvent`, `RunResult`,
  `RunStatus`, `ProgressEvent`/`ProgressPhase`, `SourceStatus`,
  `ConnectorInfo`, `VerifyIssue`/`VerifyReport`, `DoctorCheck`,
  `MaintenanceReport`, `RestoreReport`, `Capabilities`, `ItemKind`,
  `AuthCapture`. 11 unit tests, all green; `cargo clippy -D warnings` and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- **Added:** `.github/workflows/ci-rust.yml` (fmt --check, clippy -D
  warnings, test) now that a manifest exists — repo-config's audit had
  correctly skipped it until now.
- **Deliberately deferred:** `RunContext` (the reference's per-run injected
  context) isn't implemented yet — it depends on `Secrets`/
  `ManagedHTTPClient`/`CancelToken`, which don't exist yet (separate
  issues). It belongs with the connector trait (#4), not the plain data
  model.
- New dependencies: `serde` + `serde_json` + `chrono` (with `serde`
  feature) — all pre-approved in `gap-analysis.md`'s foundational-dependency
  decision.

## Add parity-loop gap analysis against Daily-Backup-System
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** `gap-analysis.md` — a full-feature-parity assessment against
  [baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System](https://github.com/baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System)
  (pinned `@6cc6491`), produced by the `parity-loop` skill. 66 rows across
  core/engine, storage, config, crypto, exports, restore/maintain, CLI, web
  tier, research, and 14 connectors, since the reference has no comparable
  Rust surface to diff and this repo has no roadmap doc of its own yet.
- **Decided (user-confirmed):** full feature parity is the round-1 scope;
  cross-platform floor (Linux + Windows) from round 1; foundational
  dependencies (SQLite, TOML/JSON, CLI parsing, HTTP, async runtime, zip,
  crypto) via standard external crates; the connector plugin registry via
  true dynamic loading (its own ADR-first issue, not a straight port);
  browser-automation connectors (reddit/skool/youtube) and the research
  subsystem both shell out to existing Python tooling (yt-dlp/Playwright,
  and [gemini-notebook-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/gemini-notebook-mcp-cli)
  for NotebookLM) rather than reimplementing browser automation in Rust.
- **Known limitation:** the RustyMill sibling check (`rusty_db`,
  `rusty_json`, `rusty_http`, etc.) is name/purpose-only, not
  source-verified — this session can't attach `Rusty-Mill/*` repos
  (cross-owner restriction, already holds `baileyrd`-owned repos). Real
  verification needs a session that can reach that org, done per-issue in
  step 3, not assumed from the table.

## Replace hand-reconstructed PR/issue templates with the real source
**2026-08-12**

- **Fixed:** swapped the four hand-reconstructed PR templates and two
  hand-reconstructed issue templates for the actual files from
  `baileyrd/skill_pack` (`my_loops/repo-config/assets/templates/.github/`,
  commit `ae532fb`), now that this session has that repo cloned. The
  reconstructions from the previous entry turned out to differ meaningfully
  from source, not just cosmetically — most notably the issue templates are
  GitHub issue-form YAML (`bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`) with
  structured fields, not the plain Markdown-with-frontmatter files guessed
  from the changelog description. `config.yml` also gained a
  `Security vulnerability` contact link (pointing at this repo's GitHub
  Security Advisories) and `blank_issues_enabled: false`, both present in
  source and absent from the reconstruction.
- **Reported upstream:** filed
  [baileyrd/skill_pack#1](https://github.com/baileyrd/skill_pack/issues/1)
  documenting this as (at least) a third occurrence of the sync-gap pattern
  already logged twice in that repo's own `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — the local
  `synced/repo-config` copy was missing `assets/templates/.github/` entirely
  and had lost the executable bit on both scripts, while the source repo
  itself is confirmed correct on both counts.
- CI workflow still correctly absent — no `Cargo.toml` yet to run it against.

## Apply repo-config governance scaffold
**2026-08-12**

- **Added:** initial governance file set via the `repo-config` skill — README,
  CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES (this file),
  ARCHITECTURE, an ADR seed, four PR templates, and two issue templates + config.
- **Context:** repo was fully empty (no commits, no manifest, no branches) except
  for a configured `git remote origin` — so `{{OWNER_REPO}}` (`baileyrd/rusty_dbs`)
  and `{{SECURITY_CONTACT}}` (`baileyrd`, the repo owner) resolved for real rather
  than staying placeholders, per the skill's default-to-owner rule. Project intent
  (a Rust reimplementation of
  [baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System](https://github.com/baileyrd/Daily-Backup-System))
  came from the user, since nothing existed yet to infer it from.
- **Known limitation, stated rather than hidden:** the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`,
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, and CI-workflow assets were missing from this session's
  locally synced copy of the `repo-config` skill — a documented recurring sync gap
  (see the skill's own `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, "Record a sync-gap finding"). Pulling the
  canonical versions from the skill's source repo (`baileyrd/skill_pack`) was blocked
  by this session's repo-access scope, so the PR and issue templates here were
  hand-reconstructed from that same source file's description of their contents
  rather than copied verbatim — worth a diff against `skill_pack` once this session
  has access, to confirm they match. CI workflow was correctly skipped (no manifest
  yet to run against), so that particular gap didn't matter this time.
- No Rust code has landed yet — `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s boundary table and README's
  Getting Started section are left as scaffolding on purpose; there's nothing real
  to put in them until the first slice of the reimplementation exists.
