# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code sessions (and any agents they dispatch) working in this repo.

This file came from `rusty_remind_me` and now sits at the merged workspace
root, so it applies to both halves — the commit-signing rule below is about
this container, not about either product.

## Commit signing: retry once, then commit unsigned and say so

This environment signs commits via a helper at `/tmp/code-sign` (a symlink to
the session's `environment-manager`, using an SSH signing key configured via
`gpg.ssh.program`/`gpg.format`/`user.signingkey` in the *global* git config —
nothing about this is set at the repo level). That symlink goes missing when
the container's `/tmp` is cleared, which makes `git commit` fail with:

```
fatal: cannot exec '/tmp/code-sign': No such file or directory
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

When any Claude Code session or dispatched agent hits this:

1. **Wait ~15–30 seconds and retry the commit once.** Sometimes the helper is
   only briefly absent around a container/session boundary and the retry
   succeeds cleanly.
2. **If the retry also fails, commit unsigned** (`--no-gpg-sign`) and state
   plainly in the commit message *and* in the reply that it is unsigned and
   why. Do not stall the task waiting for a human.
3. **Never bypass any other hook or check on your own initiative**, and never
   pass `--no-verify`. This exception is specific to commit signing when the
   helper is genuinely unreachable — it is not licence to skip tests, lint, or
   pre-commit hooks under time pressure.
4. **Do not silently paper over it.** An unsigned commit that does not say it
   is unsigned is worse than a blocked one, because the history then misreports
   its own provenance. If you claim a commit is unsigned, check first — verify
   with `git cat-file commit HEAD` and look for a `gpgsig` header rather than
   `git log --format=%G?`, whose `N` can mean "cannot verify" (no
   `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile`) rather than "not signed".

This supersedes the previous version of this section, which told agents to stop
and report instead. That rule cost a full work session: the helper stayed
missing for the rest of the run, and a completed, tested change sat uncommitted
across repeated automated nudges waiting for a human who had already moved on.
Blocking is the wrong default when the failure is environmental and the fix is
one clearly-labelled flag.
