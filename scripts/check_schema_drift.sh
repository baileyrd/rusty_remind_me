# Fail if this port's SCHEMA_VERSION has fallen behind `remind_me`'s.
#
# ARCHITECTURE.md §1 Tenet 3 makes an identical SQLite schema the definition of
# parity, and `remind_me` reads `PRAGMA user_version` on open and skips
# migrating anything already at its own target. A port that claims a version
# whose migrations it has not performed is therefore not merely behind — it
# makes the reference *skip* the very steps that would fix it.
#
# This exists because that drift opened and went unnoticed for a day. The
# reference merged its issues #167 and #220, moving 27 -> 29, and nothing in
# either repo said a word: the port's own tests all passed, because they
# compared the port against itself. It was found by hand.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check_schema_drift.sh                     # clones the reference
#   scripts/check_schema_drift.sh /path/to/remind_me  # uses a local checkout
#
# Exit codes: 0 versions agree, 1 they differ, 2 the check could not run.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The distinction between exit 1 and exit 2 is the whole design.
#
# A drift check that cannot find one of the constants must not compare two
# empty strings, find them equal, and report success. That failure mode is
# precisely what this file is defending against, so it is worth being blunt:
# every extraction below asserts it matched *exactly one* line and that the
# captured text is a number, and anything else exits 2 rather than comparing.
# A check that silently passes is worse than no check, because it also
# suppresses the suspicion that would have prompted a manual look.

ARCHITECTURE.md Tenet 3 makes an identical schema the definition of parity,
and the two implementations are expected to read the same database file.

This is not only "the port is behind". \`remind_me\` skips any migration whose
version is already stamped, so a database this port writes at $port_version will
never receive the reference's steps up to $reference_version, on any machine.

To close it:

  1. python3 scripts/regenerate_schema.py --reference /path/to/remind_me
  2. port whatever data migrations the new versions perform -- the schema
     regeneration only carries DDL, and a version can be data-only (v29 was)
  3. bump SCHEMA_VERSION in $PORT_FILE
  4. update the literal in the_schema_version_is_the_references_current_one
     (crates/remind_me_core/tests/schema_test.rs)
