# Fail if `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s "version" has drifted from the
# workspace version in the root Cargo.toml.
#
# The two are independent, hand-maintained fields — nothing in Cargo itself
# ties a plugin manifest's version to a `[workspace.package]` version — so a
# PR that bumps one and forgets the other would otherwise ship a release
# whose attached plugin archive still claims the previous version. This is
# the schema-drift check's shape applied to that gap: catch it in CI, in
# seconds, rather than after a mismatched release is already published.
#
# Exit codes: 0 versions agree, 1 they differ, 2 the check could not run.
