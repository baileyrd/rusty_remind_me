//! The storage interface, and the two backends behind it.
//!
//! # Why a trait at all
//!
//! The reference hub is Postgres-only. This one runs on either Postgres or
//! SQLite, and `docs/adr/0015` records why: a hub that cannot take over an
//! existing Postgres deployment is not a successor, and a hub that *requires*
//! Postgres is a heavy ask of the single-operator self-host case the SQLite
//! node already serves happily.
//!
//! # What the trait deliberately does not expose
//!
//! No connections, no transactions, no SQL. Every method is one complete
//! operation, because the two backends differ in exactly the places a leakier
//! interface would have to paper over: sequences (`nextval` vs. `MAX(...)+1`),
//! upsert syntax, JSONB vs. TEXT-holding-JSON, planner statistics that only
//! one of them has.
//!
//! [`HubStore::apply_record`] is the sharpest case. The reference wraps each
//! record in its own savepoint so one malformed record cannot poison a batch,
//! and *that isolation is part of the operation*, not something a caller can
//! be trusted to remember. So the trait takes one already-validated
//! [`Record`] and owns the transaction around it.
