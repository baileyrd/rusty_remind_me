//! Optional upload of a finished local backup to S3-compatible storage.
//!
//! # The plaintext gate is the point of this module
//!
//! When `REMIND_ME_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set, the backup file is already
//! ciphertext, so shipping it to a third-party bucket is safe by default.
//! When it is **not** set, that file is **plaintext personal data** — every
//! memory the vault holds, in the clear.
//!
//! Uploading it therefore requires the explicit
//! `REMIND_ME_BACKUP_S3_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_UPLOAD` opt-in, checked **before any
//! client is constructed or any byte leaves the machine**. Without that gate,
//! "enable cloud backup" would quietly mean "start shipping an unencrypted
//! copy of everything you have ever stored to a third party" — a materially
//! different decision from the one the user thinks they are making.
//!
//! Uploading plaintext personal data to third-party storage needs explicit
//! consent, not silent default behaviour.
//!
//! # No bespoke credential configuration
//!
//! There are deliberately **no** `REMIND_ME_BACKUP_S3_*` credential variables.
//! The AWS SDK already has a standard credential chain — environment, shared
//! credentials file, instance role — and reinventing a parallel one would be a
//! second secret-storage convention to get right, with none of the existing
//! hardening. Only non-secret configuration is read here: bucket, prefix,
//! endpoint, region.
//!
//! # A post-backup hook that can never damage the backup
//!
//! This runs only after the local file is finalised. A failed, refused or
//! misconfigured upload never undoes or blocks the local backup that already
//! succeeded, and nothing here can make a half-written file visible. Every
//! failure is reported to the caller as an outcome, never raised into the
//! backup path — the same rule the notification channels follow.
