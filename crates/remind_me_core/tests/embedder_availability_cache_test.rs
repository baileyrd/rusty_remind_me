//! `available_embedder`'s availability cache must expire on a configuration
//! change, not only on its TTL.
//!
//! The cache exists so the hot search path does not pay a ping round-trip per
//! call, and a failed probe is held for 30 seconds. Keyed on time alone, that
//! verdict outlived the thing it was a verdict *about*: point the backend at a
//! daemon that is actually up, and the answer stayed "not answering" for the
//! rest of the TTL, because nothing invalidated the failure the old address
//! earned. `resolve_embedder`'s own documentation promises the opposite — "a
//! configuration change takes effect on the next search rather than requiring
//! a restart" — and the availability-gated resolver quietly did not honour it.
//!
//! This surfaced as an intermittent CI failure rather than a bug report:
//! `remind_me_mcp`'s `test_server_status_reports_embeddings_active_...` binds
//! a fake daemon on a fresh port, and inherited the stale failure from
//! whichever test had last probed an unreachable one in the same process. The
//! `ENV_LOCK` convention those tests follow serialises the environment, but a
//! process-global cache is not the environment, so the lock never covered it.
