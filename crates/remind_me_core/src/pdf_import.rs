//! PDF import: per-page text extraction feeding the existing chunker.
//!
//! # Behind an optional feature
//!
//! A PDF parser is 71 transitive crates, and most builds do not want one. The
//! `pdf` feature gates it, mirroring the reference's own lazily-imported
//! extra. With the feature off, a `.pdf` import reports the format as
//! unavailable with an actionable message rather than failing obscurely or —
//! worse — succeeding with nothing.
//!
//! # Per page, not per document
//!
//! Each page is chunked separately and carries `{"page": N}`. A page is the
//! only positional anchor a PDF reliably has, and it is what lets a search hit
//! be found again in the original. Extracting the document as one string would
//! save a little code and lose that entirely.
//!
//! # A PDF with no extractable text is refused, not imported as nothing
//!
//! A pure scan — a photographed page, an image-only export — parses fine and
//! yields empty text on every page. Recorded as a successful import of zero
//! memories, that is indistinguishable from importing an empty file, which is
//! precisely the silent failure issue #147 fixed for JSONL transcripts. It
//! says what happened and points at OCR instead.
