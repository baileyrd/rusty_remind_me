//! Importance-recalibration candidates.
//!
//! [`crate::vitality`] seeds `base_weight` at write time from `memory_type` and
//! `source` — an importance *prior* — and adjusts it from explicit
//! `remind_me_feedback` signals. Nothing re-examines whether that original
//! classification has since gone stale: a "decision" later reversed by a
//! different memory, or a "fact" superseded in spirit but never through the
//! formal triple-supersession path, both keep the importance they were born
//! with.
//!
//! This is the surfacing half of the same two-phase, client-side-judgment shape
//! [`crate::normalize`] uses: a deterministic heuristic narrows an unbounded set
//! to a reviewable batch, and the calling session decides whether any given
//! memory is actually misclassified. The reference is explicit that this is a
//! deliberate departure from its own issue text, which proposed an LLM-driven
//! background pass — neither codebase has an in-server model to call.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no apply half**. The write path already exists twice
//! over: `remind_me_reclassify`/`_batch` change `memory_type` (and the
//! `decay_rate` that follows from it), and `remind_me_feedback` nudges
//! `base_weight` alone when the type is right but the weight is not. A third
//! writer here would duplicate both.
