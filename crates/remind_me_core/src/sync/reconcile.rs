//! Reconciling this node's record counts against a remote's.
//!
//! # The verdict is the output, not the numbers
//!
//! Raw deltas are just numbers, and the benign case and the real fault differ
//! only by a sign. Four verdicts:
//!
//! - `InSync` — no drift.
//! - `PullLag` — the remote is ahead and the last pull was recent. This is the
//!   ordinary state of a healthy node between cycles.
//! - `NodeAhead` — **this node holds records the remote does not**, so pushes
//!   are not landing. Checked first, because it is the only direction that
//!   means data is at risk.
//! - `Fault` — the remote is ahead but the last successful pull is stale, or
//!   never happened. That is not lag.
//!
//! # Why "recent pull" is read from `last_pull_at`
//!
//! The same argument as `sync::status`: `last_pull_at` is the wall clock of
//! the last successful pull *attempt*, which a quiet-but-healthy remote
//! advances every cycle even with nothing to send. The `last_pull` cursor does
//! not. Judging lag by the cursor would call every quiet remote a fault.
//!
//! # One classifier, both remote kinds
//!
//! `reconcile_peer` and a hub reconcile share [`classify`] deliberately.
//! "Local greater than remote means pushes are not landing" does not depend on
//! which machine is on the other end, and a second copy is how the two would
//! eventually disagree about what drift means.
