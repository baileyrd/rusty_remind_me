//! Sync observability: is the backlog draining, and when did each remote last
//! actually answer.
//!
//! # Liveness comes from the `_at` columns, never the cursors
//!
//! `sync_log` carries both `last_pull`/`last_push` (content *cursors* — the
//! high-water mark of what has been exchanged) and `last_pull_at`/
//! `last_push_at`/`last_attempt_at` (wall-clock contact times). They answer
//! different questions and are not interchangeable.
//!
//! A quiet-but-healthy remote advances its `_at` timestamps every cycle while
//! its cursors stand still, because there is nothing new to send. Reading
//! liveness off the cursors would report that remote as stalled — and would
//! report a genuinely wedged one as fine the moment anything happened to move.
//! That is exactly the confusion the v20 migration added these columns to end.
//!
//! # The drain verdict
//!
//! A pending count alone is ambiguous: ten thousand queued rows look identical
//! whether they are draining briskly or the push is wedged. So the previous
//! observation is persisted and the *direction* reported. The first call after
//! a restart establishes a baseline and honestly says `Unknown` rather than
//! guessing.
