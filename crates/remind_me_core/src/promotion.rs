//! The refinement ladder: capture → fact → scenario → persona.
//!
//! # What was missing
//!
//! The rungs already existed; the ladder did not. `capture.rs` holds raw
//! dialog, `remind_me_decompose` turns one into atomic facts, `wiki.rs`
//! compiles topic pages and `consolidation.rs` merges near-duplicates. But
//! every promotion was agent-initiated and one-shot. Nothing walked the store
//! asking which captures were never decomposed, which facts had accumulated
//! enough to deserve a scenario, or which scenarios were stable enough to say
//! something durable about the user. `UndecomposedCapture` existed — the
//! backlog was visible and simply never worked.
//!
//! This module is the missing walk. It does not distil anything itself: it
//! reports what is *ready* to move up ([`promotion_candidates`]) and accepts
//! the distillation back ([`promote`]), which is how `remind_me_decompose`
//! already works. No LLM is called from here.
//!
//! # Why rung 1 has candidates but no promotion
//!
//! `capture → fact` promotion **is** `remind_me_decompose`, which already
//! exists, already links `source_capture_id`, already applies entity mentions
//! and already supersedes contradicted facts. A second write path to the same
//! rung would be two implementations of one operation, and they would drift.
//! So [`promotion_candidates`] unifies the backlog view across all three rungs
//! and [`promote`] refuses rung 1, naming the tool that does it.
//!
//! # Provenance is not optional
//!
//! Every promoted artifact records which memories it came from, in the
//! target-only `promotions` table. Without it a persona statement is
//! unfalsifiable — you cannot ask what it was derived from, so you cannot tell
//! whether it is still true. The table is indexed both ways, so
//! [`provenance`] answers "what did this come from" and "what was built on
//! this" at the same cost.
//!
//! That is also what makes **demotion** automatic. [`persona`] excludes any
//! statement whose sources have all been superseded or deleted, so a fact
//! contradicted through `supersede_contradicting_facts` silently withdraws the
//! persona built on it, with no background job and no second opinion about
//! what "still true" means.
//!
//! # Not in the generated schema
//!
//! `promotions` is target-only, created by [`ensure_schema`] the way
//! `vectors::ensure_schema` creates `vec_embeddings` and
//! `archive::ensure_schema` creates its own. `db/schema_tables.sql` is
//! generated verbatim from `remind_me` and is not this crate's to extend.
