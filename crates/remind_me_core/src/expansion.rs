//! Search expansions: three ways to surface memories adjacent to a result set.
//!
//! | flag | source | what it finds |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `expand_entities` | `memory_entities` | other memories mentioning the same entities |
//! | `include_neighbors` | `doc_id` / `chunk_index` | sibling chunks of the same document |
//! | `expand_co_retrieval` | `memory_associations` | memories retrieved alongside these before |
//!
//! # These sit outside the ranking
//!
//! Every expansion is returned in its own section, capped at
//! [`EXPANSION_CAP`] items with [`SNIPPET_CHARS`]-character snippets, and is
//! **never merged into the ranked results**. So they do not compete with
//! `limit`, and the caps plus the snippet length are what bound their cost —
//! they sit outside the token-budget envelope.
//!
//! For co-retrieval the one-way flow is the entire point: search results →
//! recorded associations → surfaced as *suggestions*, never as a ranking
//! input. Letting a recorded weight reach the ranking would build a feedback
//! loop where whatever was returned together once is returned together
//! forever. Keeping it out means no decay maths is needed to counteract one.
//!
//! Expanded hits are also deliberately **not** access-recorded: they are a
//! discovery aid surfaced by adjacency, not direct matches for the query, and
//! recording them would inflate the vitality of every neighbour on every
//! expanded search.
