//! Profiles narrowing which tools the MCP server advertises.
//!
//! # What this buys, and what it does not
//!
//! It buys **context**. Every advertised tool's name, description and input
//! schema is sent to the model on every session, and this crate is past 60
//! tools. Nothing else.
//!
//! It is emphatically **not** a fix for tool-selection accuracy. The tools that
//! genuinely compete — `search`, `list`, `get`, `entity`, all of which read as
//! "find things" — are every one of them in [`CORE`], so no profile separates
//! them. Anyone reaching for a profile hoping the model will stop confusing
//! those four will be disappointed, and it is better to say so than to let the
//! feature imply otherwise.
//!
//! # Unknown tools default to the most restricted tier
//!
//! [`allowed_tools`] treats anything outside `CORE` and `MAINTENANCE` as
//! admin/ops. A tool added later therefore starts hidden under a narrowed
//! profile rather than smuggling itself onto a surface someone deliberately
//! trimmed — the safe direction for a list that will keep growing.
//!
//! # Hidden means gone
//!
//! A hidden tool is absent from `tools/list` *and* refused on `tools/call`.
//! Merely undocumented would be worse than not having profiles: a model that
//! guessed the name would still reach it, and the caller would have no idea
//! their trimmed surface was porous.
