//! Per-memory edit history and rollback.
//!
//! # Where revisions are written, and where they deliberately are not
//!
//! Issue #109 warns that "a revision row has to be written by every existing
//! mutation path" and lists seven tools, then asks for that list to be audited
//! against the reference rather than assumed. The audit answer is that the
//! reference writes revisions from **exactly one** place: its update path
//! (`tools/crud.py`'s `_apply_memory_field_update`). Reclassify, normalize,
//! annotate, consolidate and decompose record nothing.
//!
//! That is followed here rather than "corrected", and the reasoning holds up:
//! a revision exists to recover a value a human replaced, and the other paths
//! either add derived data alongside the original (normalize, decompose,
//! annotate) or change classification metadata that is itself recomputable
//! (reclassify). Recording all of them would bury the edits worth reverting in
//! machine-generated noise.
//!
//! # What counts as an edit
//!
//! Only the columns an update can change — content, category, tags, metadata,
//! sensitive — and only when the incoming value genuinely differs from what is
//! stored. Two consequences fall out, both wanted:
//!
//! - a same-value update creates no revision, mirroring the outbox trigger's
//!   "only on genuine change" discipline (issue #100);
//! - access tracking, which writes `accessed_at`/`access_count` and no tracked
//!   column, never produces one. A vault would otherwise accumulate a revision
//!   per read.
