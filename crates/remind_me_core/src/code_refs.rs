//! Notice when the code a memory refers to changes underneath it (#260).
//!
//! # The filed issue's mechanism does not work
//!
//! #260 proposed reusing [`crate::watcher`]'s scan: anchor a memory to a path
//! inside a configured watch directory, and let the watcher's existing
//! per-file signature check notice when it changes. That cannot fire for the
//! issue's own motivating example. `watcher::collect` only enumerates files
//! whose extension is in [`crate::import_paths::SUPPORTED_SUFFIXES`] —
//! `json`, `md`, `txt`, `pdf`, images, audio. `.rs` is not there, is not
//! going to be there, and should not be: that list means *importable document
//! formats*, not *files worth noticing*. A memory saying "don't touch
//! `auth.rs`" anchored to a watch directory would simply never be rescanned,
//! because the watcher never looks at `.rs` files in the first place.
//!
//! # What this does instead
//!
//! Detecting staleness does not need directory enumeration at all — it needs
//! to re-check a **specific, already-known path**, which is a single `stat`.
//! So there is no watcher integration and no background loop here:
//! [`stale_candidates`] stats each anchored path *on demand*, when asked.
//! That sidesteps the extension filter entirely (any file can be anchored,
//! source code included) and avoids inventing a second background poll next
//! to `watcher`'s.
//!
//! It also means a path never needs to sit inside a *document* watch
//! directory to be anchored. It needs to sit inside a
//! [`CODE_ROOTS_ENV`]-configured root instead — a boundary that exists for
//! the same reason [`crate::import_paths`]'s containment check does: so
//! anchoring is bounded to directories the operator named, not "anything on
//! the machine a memory happens to mention the name of".
//!
//! # Flag, never supersede
//!
//! A changed file does not prove a memory's claim false — the statement may
//! still hold after a refactor. [`stale_candidates`] is read-only and never
//! writes to the memory it reports on, matching the shape of
//! [`crate::contradictions::candidates`] and
//! [`crate::promotion::promotion_candidates`]: a list for a caller to judge,
//! not an automatic demotion.
