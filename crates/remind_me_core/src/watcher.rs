//! Watched-folder ingestion: files appear in a directory, memories appear in
//! the store.
//!
//! # Polling, deliberately
//!
//! Directories are scanned on an interval rather than watched through
//! filesystem events. That is a choice, not a limitation: it needs no
//! additional dependency, it behaves identically on every platform, and it
//! matches the background-loop shape the rest of the system uses. An
//! event-based watcher would be a defensible alternative; it would also be a
//! new dependency and a new class of platform-specific failure.
//!
//! # The debounce is the subtle part
//!
//! A file whose modification time is younger than [`DEFAULT_GRACE_SECONDS`] is
//! **deferred** until a later scan observes the same `(mtime, size)`
//! signature. That is what stops a file being ingested while it is still being
//! written — a half-flushed export would otherwise become a truncated memory
//! that dedup then pins in place, because its hash is stable and wrong.
//!
//! A file modified *before* the grace window — the ordinary startup-backlog
//! case — ingests immediately. Only implementing the delay would give you a
//! watcher that waits a minute before touching anything on every restart.
//!
//! # Changed files supersede their previous import
//!
//! Re-importing an edited file leaves the previous version's chunks in the
//! store, where they would keep matching searches. Those memories are marked
//! superseded, which every read path already excludes. A memory the user
//! explicitly deleted is left alone — a re-import must not resurrect or
//! silently alter something someone chose to remove.
