//! Rolling back a bulk import.
//!
//! Imports are the one bulk write this crate makes, and `remind_me_delete`
//! takes a single id — unusable at import scale, where a mempalace run can be
//! tens of thousands of records.
//!
//! Two things make this more than a `DELETE ... WHERE`:
//!
//! **Deletion goes through [`crate::db::queries::delete_memory`]**, the same
//! path `remind_me_delete` uses, so chunk vectors, entity mention links,
//! feedback and associations are cleaned up. A hand-written bulk `DELETE`
//! against `memories` would orphan every one of them — and orphaned
//! `vec_chunks` rows are actively dangerous, because SQLite reuses freed
//! rowids and a later memory landing on the same one would silently inherit
//! them.
//!
//! **The import's tracking rows go too.** Every import path treats a tracked
//! id as already done and skips it, so leaving those behind would make the
//! same content permanently un-importable — the undo would appear to work and
//! then silently refuse to let you redo it.
//!
//! On a sync-enabled node this is a soft delete, so the removal propagates
//! rather than resurrecting on the next pull. That also means the space is not
//! reclaimed until tombstones are compacted.
