//! Symbolic compression: a capture's shape, cheap to read, with drill-down.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! [`crate::capture`] stores a conversation as two linked memories: the
//! verbatim dialog and a summary. There is nothing between them. A caller
//! wanting more than the summary has only the whole transcript, and on a long
//! session that is thousands of tokens to answer a question about its shape.
//!
//! A **skeleton** is a third artifact at that missing altitude: a Mermaid
//! diagram of the conversation's structure, whose nodes each name a line range
//! in the dialog. Reading it costs a diagram; following one node costs one
//! turn. Neither costs the transcript.
//!
//! # Who draws it
//!
//! The calling agent's model, handed back through [`write_skeleton`] — exactly
//! how `remind_me_decompose` already works. Nothing here calls an LLM, so this
//! adds no model dependency to the server.
//!
//! # Line ranges, and why they are validated at write time
//!
//! Nodes address the dialog by inclusive, 1-based line range. A model can
//! count lines; it cannot reliably count characters, and a character offset
//! that is wrong by forty is indistinguishable from a correct one until
//! someone reads the slice it returns.
//!
//! Every range is therefore checked against the dialog's actual line count
//! *before* the skeleton is stored. A skeleton that would return the wrong
//! bytes is refused outright rather than written and discovered later —
//! drill-down whose answers are subtly wrong is worse than no drill-down,
//! because it reads as authoritative.
//!
//! # Stored as a capture row, not a new table
//!
//! The skeleton is a third memory sharing the `capture_id`, distinguished by
//! its metadata `type` exactly as the dialog and summary are. That means
//! [`crate::capture::get_capture`] already finds it (in `other`, until it
//! learns the name), sync already carries it, and deleting a capture already
//! takes it along. A separate table would have needed all three rebuilt.
