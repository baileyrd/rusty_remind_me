//! The remind-me sync hub: a central sync point speaking the peer protocol.
//!
//! A port of the reference's `hub/main.py` — a FastAPI server backed by
//! Postgres — with one deliberate addition: the storage backend is behind a
//! trait, so the same hub runs on Postgres (the drop-in for an existing
//! deployment) or on SQLite (a self-hosted hub that wants one file and no
//! server). `docs/adr/0015` records why.
//!
//! # What a hub is, relative to a peer
//!
//! The same wire protocol against a different topology. Nodes push to and pull
//! from a hub; the hub never pulls. `remind_me_core::sync::server` already
//! serves the peer side of this protocol, and a node cannot tell the two
//! apart — which is the point.
//!
//! Routes:
//!
//! | Route | Auth | Purpose |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `GET /health` | none | liveness; 200 reachable, 503 not |
//! | `GET /stats` | bearer | the full aggregate, once per reconcile |
//! | `GET /count` | bearer | scalar counts, cheap enough to poll |
//! | `GET /metrics` | bearer | Prometheus text, off by default |
//! | `POST /admin/compact_tombstones` | bearer | hard-delete expired tombstones |
//! | `POST /sync/push` | bearer | upsert a batch, LWW on `updated_at` |
//! | `GET /sync/pull` | bearer | memory records since a cursor |
//! | `GET /sync/pull_entities` | bearer | entity records |
//! | `GET /sync/pull_links` | bearer | memory↔entity links |
//! | `GET /sync/pull_entity_relations` | bearer | typed entity edges |
//!
//! # The one hub-only column
//!
//! `origin_node` records *which node pushed* a record, and never leaves the
//! hub. Pull's `exclude_node` filters on it rather than on the record's own
//! `node_id`, and that difference is deliberate: a client never rewrites
//! `node_id` on update, so filtering on it would make a record's creator deaf
//! to every later edit other nodes push. Peers compensate by pushing to each
//! other; a hub is pull-only, so it must track pushers itself.
